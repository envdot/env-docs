# API Keys

env connects directly to AI provider APIs. You'll need to add your own API keys to use each provider.

## Adding API Keys

1. Open **Settings** (⌘ + ,)
2. Navigate to **API Keys**
3. Enter your key for each provider you want to use
4. Click **Save**

<Note>
  API keys are stored securely in your macOS Keychain. They never leave your device.

## Security

<Warning>
  Never share your API keys. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

env takes security seriously:

- **Local Storage**: Keys are stored in macOS Keychain, encrypted at rest
- **No Telemetry**: We don't collect or transmit your keys
- **Direct Connection**: API calls go directly to providers, not through our servers

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error

- Double-check for extra spaces when pasting
- Ensure the key hasn't been revoked in your provider dashboard
- Verify you have billing set up (some providers require it)

### "Rate Limited" Error

- You've hit your provider's rate limit
- Wait a few minutes or upgrade your plan with the provider
